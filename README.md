## Concise Summary: Living OpenAI Agents SDK Repository

This repository is a continuously evolving collection of practical examples and experiments with the OpenAI Agents SDK. As new SDK features or agentic patterns emerge, related code snippets and mini-projects are added to demonstrate real-world usage.

### Key Points
- **Purpose**: Provide hands-on code for concepts like triage/handoff agents, tool integration, structured outputs, tracing, and model configuration.
- **Structure**: Each example lives in its own script or notebook (e.g., `handoff3.py` for escalation flows, `structured.py` for Pydantic outputs). A concise README links to detailed documentation (e.g., a PDF in `docs/`) and summarizes available examples.
- **Usage**: Clone the repo, set up the environment via `uv sync`, configure `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env`, and run examples with `uv run <script>.py`. Optionally use Chainlit for an interactive UI.
- **Living Repository**: New experiments are added over time. Contributors and readers can suggest or submit additional examples as the SDK evolves.
- **Best Practices**: Secure API keys, use virtual environments, modular agent design (triage/coordinator patterns), clear prompts/instructions, structured output enforcement, tracing for debugging, and usage monitoring.
- **Invitation**: Clone and explore the examples, submit issues or PRs with new use-cases, and follow updates as deeper dives into the OpenAI Agents SDK are added.
