# HANDOFF

The **HANDOFF** folder includes a series of examples that demonstrate multi-agent handoff patterns, such as triage and escalation. Handoff scenarios involve one agent transferring a task or query to another agent (or among several agents) based on certain conditions, which is useful for building systems where specialized agents handle different parts of a workflow.

-   **handoff1.py** – A basic handoff scenario. This script likely introduces two agents: perhaps an initial agent that, upon recognizing a certain type of query or context, hands off control to a second agent. For example, Agent A might be a general assistant and Agent B a specialist; `handoff1.py` shows Agent A delegating a question to Agent B when appropriate.
    
-   **handoff2.py** – An extended handoff example, possibly involving a triage agent. Here, an agent might act as a router or coordinator, choosing between multiple specialist agents. The script could demonstrate logic where Agent T (triage) inspects the user’s request and then forwards it to Agent X or Agent Y depending on the topic. It builds on the basic idea by handling more than one possible handoff target.
    
-   **handoff3.py** – A more complex multi-step escalation. In this script, the handoff might occur through multiple layers (for instance, Agent A hands off to Agent B, which might further invoke Agent C). This could simulate a support escalation: e.g., a user query first goes to a bot, then is escalated to a more advanced agent if not resolved. `handoff3.py` likely implements checks and fallbacks, demonstrating how context is passed along the chain.
    
-   **handoff4.py** – An advanced or variant scenario of agent handoffs. This might integrate tools or human handoff as part of the flow. For example, after passing through agents, the final step might be handing off to a human operator (though not literally a human here, but perhaps logging that as an endpoint). Alternatively, it could show a different pattern such as round-robin delegation or a collaborative handoff where multiple agents contribute to the answer.
    

Each of these scripts can be executed to simulate the handoff behavior. By reading through them, developers can understand how to maintain state between agents, how to use the Agents SDK to chain agents together, and how to design conditional logic for delegation. These patterns are useful for building complex AI systems (like customer support bots or multi-expert systems) where one agent alone isn’t sufficient for all tasks.
